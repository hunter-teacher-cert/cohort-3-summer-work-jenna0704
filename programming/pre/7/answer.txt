Exercise 2

public static int banana(int[] a) {
    int kiwi = 1;
    int i = 0;
    while (i < a.length) {
        kiwi = kiwi * a[i];
        i++;
    }
    return kiwi;
}

//This method takes an int array and returns the product of the elements. Before the loop, we initialize kiwi to 1. Each time through the loop, we update kiwi by multiplying an element from the aray. 


public static int grapefruit(int[] a, int grape) {
    for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        if (a[i] == grape) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

//This method takes an int array and an integer value and returns the index where the value appears. Variable grape is the target value in the array. If we find the target value in the array, we return its index. If there's no target value in the array, we return -1. 


public static int pineapple(int[] a, int apple) {
    int pear = 0;
    for (int pine: a) {
        if (pine == apple) {
            pear++;
        }
    }
    return pear;
}

//This method takes an in array and an integer value and returns the number of elements that have the same value as apple. Before the loop, we initialize pear to 0. pine is the index of the elements in array a. Each time through the loop, we count the number of times the value appears and add 1 to pear.
